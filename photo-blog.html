    <strong>Photography</strong> can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming, especially if you’ve never been on the otherside of the camera. Luckily, I’m here to give you an insider’s view to how and where to start. By taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut, you’ll be on your journey of becoming the photographer you've always wanted to be!

<h2>Figuring out your niche</h2>

  <p>
    If you already know what you're going to take photos of then great! that's you're niche. To those who still don't know don't fret! a simple list of subjects (person,thing,place etc in frame) can be very help when starting off. below I'll share of list of examples.

  <ul>
    <li>Portrait photography</li>
    <li>Product/Brand photography</li>
    <li>Wedding photography</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Getting over the imposter-syndrome</h2>

  <p>
    It gets werid, at some point you might find yourself asking "am I a photographer or just someone with a camera?". When that time comes ask yourself why are you even doing it?
    as in- are you doing photography for you or do you just want a title?
    Photography just like any other form of art is a never-ending investment into yourself. Their will always be something new to learn, new equpitment and software to update and upgrade too.
    So when you have those moments and you know why you're doing it you'll be fine. My advice is to keep at it; <strong>especially</strong> when you take photos you're not proud of (i.e unintentionally blurry, overexposed) those are the moments where you grow the most!
   </p>
     <h2>Most important thing!</h2>
  <p>
    Have fun!, don't stress yourself out in the beging of your journey, avoid comparing yourself to other photographers and don't copy anyone's work. Instead use their work to inspire you or to motivate you into becomng the best photo-artist you can be!
